This is the Kingdom Specifications document. You may edit all the numbers 
(after the colons) to specify different things about the kingdom that will
be chosen.
If an option has 0 next to it, then it is set to "off".
If an option has 1 next to it, then it is set to "on".
To specify an exact number of cards of a certain type, set the between x and x 
numbers to the same number. (For example, setting the numbers to between 1 and 1 
attacks will result in exactly 1 attack card being chosen.)

Do not modify anything besides the numbers below.
