I made this project after my first year in Programming classes. It started out as just a project to select 10 cards from the deck to play a game of Dominion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)). The scope grew and grew and I didn't plan well ahead of time to keep the project structure clean. It's got tons of repeated code that should be put inside functions, and it generally needs to be refactored. But, overall it was a fun project!
