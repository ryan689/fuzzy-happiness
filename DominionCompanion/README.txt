I made this project after my first year in Programming classes. It started out as just a project to select 10 cards from the deck to play a game of Dominion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)). The main overall output of the program is just to print out a set of cards to be used to play the card game. Many websites or apps did this but mostly just randomly selected cards, and I tried to make my own version that could take into account the specifics of the game and give a more "intelligent" but still psuedo-random selection. The scope grew and grew and I didn't plan well ahead of time to keep the project structure clean. It's got tons of repeated code that should be put inside functions, and it generally feels hack-y and needs to be refactored. But, overall it was a fun project!
